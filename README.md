# Coding Dojo: [Password Validation](https://www.codurance.com/katalyst/password-validation)

I'd like to think that what I amb going to do will resemble [outside-in design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHnuMjah6ps&pp=ugMICgJlcxABGAE%3D).

# First iteration

On this iteration, we only consider a basic password validation. A method receives the password `string` format, and
returns if the password is valid or not.

I have to say that, being this iteration so simple, I have struggled to get an acceptance test that made sense. In fact,
the acceptance test I've written for this iteration provides zero value.

Also, the feature was not that test-drivable (from my POV)
